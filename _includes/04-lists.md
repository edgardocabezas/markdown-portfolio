# About Me
A successful corporate career in multinational companies, with 30 years of experience in the different areas of
information technology, administration and management of projects of corporate scope, specializations in the life cycle
of services and, recently, completing the Certification of Executive Coaching. These form the knowledge base that is
my wish to put to service for clients and companies in order to provide guidance, support and execution of processes
of transformations to organizations that require it.

Additionally, customer service, strategic planning, technology governance, value proposition, portfolio of services,
implementation of new technologies and project management are the main areas of development as an independent
consultant.
